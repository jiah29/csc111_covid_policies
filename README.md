CSC111 Project: Picturing the Power of Policy in a Pandemic

Since the emergence of COVID-19 in 2019, governments across the world have had to act urgently and make difficult decisions concerning their health security policies. From imposing strict social isolation rules to mask mandates, the policies that governments have enacted to curtail the spread of the virus have imposed massive costs to businesses, economies, and the livelihoods of humanity. Such policies have stirred controversy across the globe regarding finding an equilibrium between protecting public health and supporting the economy, while reducing inequity. As the publicâ€™s response to policies is equally as significant as governance when it comes to reducing the transmission of COVID-19, the differences in the approaches that countries have undertaken on a global scale motivated us to understand which strategy is most optimal. As a result, the question that we are interested in investigating is as follows: How can we compare different policy responses to the number of cases and deaths in the respective countries to recommend an optimal approach for future pandemics? 

In this project, we are interested in analyzing the efficacy of global policy responses concerning stay-at-home restrictions, school and workplace closures, cancellation of public events and gatherings, public information campaigns, face coverings, testing and contact tracing, and vaccination policies in reducing deaths and cases. In doing so, we hope to learn more about the interconnections between policies and their role in reducing transmission of COVID-19, and shed light on the policy response(s) that have been most effective in their respective regions.
